    <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>
        <label>Artificial intelligence is the ability of a computer to replicate human intelligence, cognitive
                ability, and grasp abstract concepts. AI is playing a key role in furthering research in
                medicine, where it is used in expert systems to draw connections between illnesses to
                form diagnoses. </label>

    <h2>Examples of the use of this technology</h2>
    <label>Self-driven cars, high-end robotics, AI-driven traffic management, Smart grid maintenance, etc., are a few things that one alludes to when talking of AI.</label>

			<li><b>Travel and navigation</b><br>We might have used navigation services or others to find our way through at some point in our lives. For many, it is part of their daily lives. Whether using maps for navigation or using a taxi-hire service like Uber, you are using AI-enabled services to travel from one place to another. Google, Apple, and many other navigation-related service providers utilize AI to interpret the scores of information being received and provide you with information that helps in navigation and get live traffic updates, allowing you to commute more efficiently.</li>
			<li><b>Smartphone Apps</b><br>Imagining our lives without mobile phones does sound to be a challenge. Different applications on our mobiles have become an integral part of our daily lives. Many of these applications are based on AI. Built-in smart assistants on our phones like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant are the more obvious examples of AI that most of us are aware of and use. More mobile technology platforms are developing solutions that use AI for managing different aspects of the device like battery management, event suggestions, etc. One of the standard features, like using a portrait mode on the phone, also uses AI. AI-enabled services are now a significant part of the updates on both iOS and Android platforms.</li>
			<li><b>Voice Recgonition</b><br>AI is seen within voice recognition systems which are now common within smart home
                    systems such as Google Home and Amazon’s Alexa. These have increased convenience
                    for people but raise questions about privacy, as they are required to be constantly
                    switched on to function</li>
			<li><b>Smart Cars</b><br>Not only are companies like Tesla at the forefront of using automation in vehicles, but many of the car manufacturers are also looking at integrating AI with Automobiles to provide seamless services of various technologies that you use.<br>Information is being shared and communicated between the cars to better maneuver amidst traffic. Inputs around traffic, real-time updates on roadblocks, etc., are immediately transmitted to alert the other vehicles on the grid enabling re-routing.</li>

            <h2>Advantages of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <div id="list">
            <ul><label>
                <li><b>Decision Making:</b> The goal of AI has always been to generate smarter decision making. It’s not that we’re not able to think critically as humans, we’re just limited in how quickly we can process and coordinate mountains of data. AI takes the job of delivering data, analyzing trends, and forecasting results—while taking the human emotion out of it. It’s able to take raw data and translate it into an objective decision.</li>
                <li><b>Reducing Errors:</b> Once the foundation of your AI and automation models are established, you’ll notice manual errors starting to disappear. Remedial tasks like data processing or onboarding become background processes—not because they’re no longer important, because there’s no longer a need for thorough oversight. Small errors simply disappear because the machine only understands accuracy</li>
                <li><b>Improves Efficiency:</b> It improves work efficiency so reduce the duration of time to accomplish a task in comparison to humans. This allows for more output during a shorter period of time. It would allow for more output than humans within a certain time period, other factors may play a part of this such as the speed of the internet. Humans may have their progress restricted as they become tired and the more tired they become the less productive they are but with AI they don't become tired.</li>
                <li><b>The best advantage: </b>The best advantage by far for me presonally and also millions of other users is chat gpt. The link to chat gpt is<a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> It is mainly used for composing emails, essays, and code which in todays world and the future will help us alot. Mainly used to cheat in school :)</li>

            <h2>Disadvantages of Artificial intelligence</h2>
            <div id="list">
            <ul><label>
                <li><b>Intention of user:</b> Machines can easily lead to destruction if the implementation of machine put in the wrong hands the results are hazardous for human beings.</li>
                <li><b>Unemployment:</b> A robot is one of the implementations of Artificial intelligence with them replacing jobs and lead to serve unemployment.</li>
                <li><b>Implementation cost is very high:</b> The difficulties with software development for AI implementation are that the development of software is slow and expensive. Few efficient programmers are available to develop software to implement artificial intelligence</li>
