        <h3><b>Censorships and the internet</b></h3>
        <label>Censorship is the act of suppressing the content that people are able to view, publish and
    access. Some countries use censorship to block out other political opinions. There is much
    debate about the extent to which government should be able to control what we have
    access to and decide what is best for the public.</label> <br>
        <label>The UK Human Rights Act protects free speech - but there are many exceptions such as incitement to racial or religious hatred, encouragement of terrorism, 'Official Secrets' and aspects of court proceedings.</label>
        <div id="list">
        <ul><label>
            <li>Films and video games are age related by non-governmental, industry bodies</li>
            <li>Court injunctions can prevent stories being printed, broadcast or published on the internet</li>
        </ul></label>
        </div>
        <br>
        <label>Censors in some cases may be a good thing as it prevents hate speech and in some cases prevents certain group of people from doing certain things, example being age restrictions to games or shows. However, there is an argument that the government controls and censors too much and that in most cases they are restricting freedom and only allowing people to do what the government wants them to do.</label>
        <label>Many people believe in the idea of a ‘Free Internet’, where nothing is filtered at all, in line
    with the principle of freedom of speech. Indeed, Tim Berners-Lee created the internet to be
    a space where people could share and mutually benefit from resources. However most
    people agree that some extent of censorship has become necessary for national security
    purposes and to filter offensive comments and extremist propaganda. </label>
        <label>Censorship can also exist on a smaller level, such as within a school in which pupils may
    be prevented from accessing material deemed to be unsuitable. Within the workplace,
    censorship may be used to maintain high productivity and prevent distractions. </label>

        <h3><b>Monitoring Behaviour</b></h3>
        <label>Computers are used to monitor people’s behaviour in various environments. In many
    workplaces, employers monitor productivity by tracking the websites and applications
    workers are accessing and the time spent on these.</label>
    
        <label>Surveillance systems and in particular, CCTV cameras are widely used for security
    purposes and to detect crime, from speeding to violence. This is useful for tracing and
    punishing criminal activity. Ankle monitors are another kind of surveillance device used on
    people under house arrest to track their location. While some people argue that this is
    unethical and contravenes basic human rights, others argue that this is a necessary
    measure that must be taken to put people off committing crime. </label>

        <p>
        <h3><b>Analyse Personal Information</b></h3>
        <label>Companies have recently become aware of the value of data, which can reveal key
    insights about people and their behaviours. Large amounts of data from a number of
    sources, called big data, can be analysed to make inferences about people’s behaviour,
    likes and dislikes, for example. This process is called data mining and can be used to
    inform personalised political propaganda, targeted advertising or alternatively, to identify
    previously unknown connections between two variables. </label>
    
        <label>There is some concern, however, that insights from personal information could reveal
    things that act against certain individuals. A common example is data mining uncovering
    that a certain individual is at high risk of developing a particular disease. With this
    information, an insurance company may deny them insurance or charge a higher premium.
    This raises ethical questions about whether companies uncovering these trends have a
    responsibility to feed this information back to users. </label>
    
    <label>Although companies are legally required to state what kinds
    of data they are collecting from you, this may not always be
    obvious to users. There is pressure on large firms to be
    more transparent about the data they collect and making it
    clearer what it will be used for. The Data Protection Act
    developed in 1998 is no longer sufficient when it comes to
    protecting public welfare which is why the GDPR has been
    enforced as of May 2018.</label>

        <p>
        <h3><b>Piracy and Offensive Communication</b></h3>
        <label>Piracy is the unauthorised copying of content, such as software or media including music
    and films. This is a form of theft and is illegal; although the Internet has made it easier than
    ever before to source these types of content online, it is up to the individual to make the
    decision as to whether or not this is ethically correct. Piracy bites into producers and steakholders profits as revenue becomes lower due to illegale access which is free.</label>
        <label>While the Internet has opened up countless positive pathways for the betterment of
    society, it also provides a seemingly anonymous front for people. Offensive
    communication refers to any sort of online harassment, including cyber-bullying or stalking.
    The Malicious Communications Act introduced in 1998 makes it a criminal offence to send
    indecent or offensive messages to anyone online and as such, this sort of behaviour can
    be traced by law enforcement organisations and result in a criminal record.</label>

        <h3><b>User Interface</b></h3>
        <label><b>Layout: </b>When web developers design websites, it is important that they consider who will be
    viewing the website and ensure the website is designed to accommodate for all of these
    people. The Equality Act introduced in 2010 makes it illegal to discriminate against
    providing a service to a certain group of people, which makes this even more important.</label>
        <label>Websites must be laid out in a way that makes it easy for users to navigate between
    pages. Menus are a common tool used to provide function and in English-speaking
    countries, menus are displayed on the left-hand side of the page. In countries such as
    Egypt or the UAE, where Arabic is the primary language, these menus may instead be
    displayed on the right-hand side of the page as Arabic is read from right to left. These sort
    of design considerations must be made by developers in order to make websites
    accessible to all people. This is particularly important for online stores, as a well laid-out
    website which is easy-to-navigate will attract more customers. </label>
        <label>Websites must also be designed in a way that makes them accessible to people with
    visual impairments or other disabilities. Some people may need to enlarge text or alter the
    contrast in order to view the contents of the website comfortably and a good website will
    cater for this. Websites should provide alternative text (alt text) for images and provide a
    screen magnifier option so people with visual impairments are not disadvantaged.
    Transcripts of audio files should be provided for those with hearing impairments.
        </label>
        <br>
        
        <label><b>Colour Paradigms: </b>When choosing a colour scheme for a website, web developers must take into account
    how different colours are interpreted around the world. Some colours are regarded as
    unlucky in certain cultures and have other negative connotations. For example, while white
    is associated with mourning in the Middle East, it is associated with purity in Western
    cultures. Typically, a neutral colour scheme with widely positive connotations will be
    chosen, such as green which represents luck and nature.</label>
    
        <label><b>Character Sets: </b>In order to make websites accessible to as wide an
    audience as possible, the contents must be translated into
    multiple languages. Some character sets are too small to
    accommodate all of the characters of a language. ASCII
    only uses seven bits and so is unable to represent all of the
    characters in the Chinese language. Therefore Unicode is
    the preferred character set as it is able to represent over a
    million characters. </label>
