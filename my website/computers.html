		<h2>Examples of changes in the work force due to technology</h2>

			<li><label>There have been changes in digital technology which have had major impacts in industries. Changes and advancements in technology have led to certain industries becoming more advanced and employing more and certain industries becoming less valuable.<br>Photography was once a big employer. in 1989 (when the web began) Kodak employed 145,000 people. but by 2015, after selling patents to escape bankruptcy, the remains of the company employed 8,000 people. The significant changes in technology have been shown by the reduction in employees as less people are needed to produce digital and physical copies of photos as the process has become much more easier. It is also common for people not in this profession to be able to produce photos without the need for professionals.</label></li>
			<li><label>Computers have also allowed for more efficient and quicker communication between clients and suppliers along with accross the business. This may help business in making better decisions as they recieve information quicker and in turn they may make smarter decisions sooner. This in turn could help increase efficiency as well as productivity as better decisions are made which would benefit the businesses output. The quicker workflow in a workplace is assisted by communincation technology as well as workplace planning software and coordination software.</label></li>
			<li><label>Computers have encouraged online shopping. Every one of us here reading this has at one point ordered something online or bought some sort of subscription online at one point, and this is because technology has advanced so much we are able to buy things with a few swipes and buttons. In 2014 sales per shopper online was about £1,071 and that increase to £1,174 in 2015. Now imagine the sales per online shopper today after many more websites and offers that are in place as well as the affects of covid being in place.</label></li>
