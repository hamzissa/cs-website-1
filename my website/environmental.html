    <h2>Effects of tech on the environemnt</h2>
    <label>With technological devices being produced cheaply and widely, they have become
        affordable for a large proportion of the world population. The downside to this is the effect
        on the environment. The pressure of keeping up with trends coupled with the affordability
        means that people now throw away more devices than before. Some computers
        components are built of mercury and radioactive isotopes which are toxic and can
        contaminate water supplies. Often, this e-waste is shipped to third world countries with
        lower environmental standards to be disposed which is considered to be immoral and
        unacceptable. <br>
        With more devices around and processes becoming partially or entirely computerised,
        more electricity is required to power these devices. This requires using up our store of
        non-renewable fossil fuels which emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing
        to global warming. The rate of climate change has accelerated over the past year,
        indicating that we need to be more careful about our consumption and cut down the
        throw-away attitude when it comes to technological devices. The effects on the planet as a
        result of our consumption will go on to impact future generations as well as biodiversity. 
        <br>
        Despite this, there has been a push in the UK for renewable energy which counteracts the
        effects of increased electricity consumption to an extent. Alongside new technologies,
        there has been a growth in environmentally-friendly technologies. Examples of this include
        smart home systems which use temperature sensors to determine when heating should be
        switched on and motion sensors to switch off lights when a room is empty. Personal
        computers and laptops offer ‘Sleep’ and ‘Stand-by’ features and some newly developed
        car engines are designed to prevent them from idling so reducing emissions. This
        suggests technology has the potential to offset some of the effects on the environment.

        <h3>How covid could have affected this</h3>
        <label>As people would be working from home this would mean fewer commuters and hence less energy on transport is used. Factories would have also been shut down or production would have been restricted and hence less energy is used. However, those working from home could mean more heating is used because of more houses would require heating, this could mean overall more energy is used compared to everyone sharing heating in one office building.</label>
        <br> <hr> <br>
        <h3>Electric Cars</h3>
        <label>As ther are an increasing number of electric cars being produced this could mean less fossil fuel used for cars and so less energy and green house gasses are released into the atmosphere. This advancement in digital technology has been shown to be beneficial as less green house gasses are emitted from cars due to more electric cars being used.<br>However, with more electric cars being produced this would mean supplies to manufacture those cars would increase along with the actual manufacturing of the cars. This may not be good for the environemnt becuase greenhouse gasses may be emitted during the production of the cars aswell as for the production of electricity to charge the cars. So technological advancements has its negative effects aswell as its positive effects and has the potential to outweight its negetives effects but as of right now the negetive effects are higher.</label>
